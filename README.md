# Sieve-Toolkit
## A toolkit for various functions of the sieve algorithm

## Description
This is a simple electron-based app for some common functions of the Sieve algorithm for prime numbers. The main point of this app was for a school project.

## Usage
Download a release binary from the [Releases](https://github.com/mahancoder/Sieve-Toolkit/releases/) section.
### Building from source
To test the app while working, run `dotnet run` to open te app in the browser. To build the app, follow the [Electron.Net build instructions](https://github.com/mahancoder/Sieve-Toolkit/releases/)

## Technology
This app uses the [Electron.Net](https://github.com/ElectronNET/Electron.NET) project along with asp.Net Core Blazor to provide a real-time HTML-based UI with fast C# Math calculations in the backend.

### Algorithms
The heart of this app, which is the math processing, is done in the `Algorithm.cs` file. I've used efficient methods to calculate the results, and also multi-threading when possible.

## Status
This app is currenlty unmaintained, however, I'm not planning on archiving the repo, because I might want to push some small changes to it from time to time.

## Language

##### This is a toolkit written as a school project for the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. The language is currently Persian for school, but I might add English support later on
